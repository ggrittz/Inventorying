### Description

This is the Research Compendium of **FlorestaSC: A double-up approach to
improve biodiversity monitoring in hyperdiverse forests**. It contains
the necessary codes to reproduce all analyses and plot images in the
article. Scripts are numerically ordered, meaning that the workflow
starts with `01_downloading_data.R` and ends with `06_base_map.R`. There
is a single internal function, `99_summInv.R`, that is loaded with
`devtools::load_all()` to summarise forest inventory data by vegetation
type. For more information about FlorestaSC, [take a look at our
website](https://en.floresta.sc.gov.br/).

### Workflow

Below is a summary of the manuscript workflow to process all data and
perform all analyses. Codes are thoroughly documented via comments
inside them. The workflow structure is as follows:

1.  **Downloading data**: the script `01_downloading_data.R` gets FURB
    herbarium occurrence records from [JBRJ
    IPT](https://ipt.jbrj.gov.br/jabot/resource?r=furb) in a DarwinCore
    format. FURB herbarium occurrence records from JABOT, however, need
    to be manually downloaded. Download instructions are inside the
    script. <br /> <br />
2.  **Preparing data**: the script `02_preparing_data.R` loads, edits,
    standardizes, cleans, and saves the data from both the forest
    inventory and floristic surveys of the FlorestaSC. These processes
    rely heavily on the `plantR` package (Lima et al., 2021). The script
    `03_preparing_lifeforms.R` extracts the registered growth form for
    each record from a field called *projeto* in the JABOT spreadsheet.
    <br /> <br />
3.  **Summarizing data**: the script `04_summarizing_data.R` loads the
    previously saved data and performs all types of operations to sum up
    our results. <br /> <br />
4.  **Plotting data**: finally, scripts `05_plotting_data.R` and
    `06_base_map.R` create all the plots shown in the main article.
