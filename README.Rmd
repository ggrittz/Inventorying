### Description

This is the Research Compendium of **FlorestaSC: A double-up approach to
improve biodiversity monitoring in hyperdiverse forests**. It contains
the necessary codes to reproduce all analyses and plot images in the
article. Scripts are numerically ordered, meaning that the workflow
starts with `01_downloading_data.R` and ends with `06_base_map.R`. There
is a single internal function, `99_summInv.R`, that is loaded with
`devtools::load_all()` to summarise forest inventory data by vegetation
type. For more information about FlorestaSC, [take a look at our
website](https://en.floresta.sc.gov.br/).

### Workflow

Codes are structured as follows:

1.  **Downloading data**: the script `01_downloading_data.R` gets FURB
    herbarium occurrences from JBRJ IPT as a DarwinCore sheet. FURB
    herbarium data from JABOT, however, needs to be manually downloaded.
    Instructions are commented in the script. <br /> <br />
2.  **Preparing data**: the script `02_preparing_data.R` loads, edits,
    cleans, and saves the data from both the forest and floristic
    inventory of the FlorestaSC project. Script
    `03_preparing_lifeforms.R` extracts the register life form from a
    field called *projeto* in the JABOT spreadsheet. This is not a DwC
    standardized field, so it cannot be extracted directly from JBRJ
    IPT. See **Downloading data**. All steps for both scripts are
    thoroughly described within them, as comments. <br /> <br />
3.  **Summarizing data**: the script `04_summarizing_data.R` loads the
    previously saved data and performs all types of operations to sum up
    our results. <br /> <br />
4.  **Plotting data**: finally, scripts `05_plotting_data.R` and
    `06_base_map.R` create all the plots shown in the main article.
